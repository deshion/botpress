# White Label

## White Labeling the Botpress UI

> **Heads-up**: White-Label is a feature only available in Botpress Pro

### Instructions

Copy the files from the `assets` folder (next to this README file) to your Botpress Server installation's `assets` folder. You should end up having a structure similar to the following:

```
├── assets
│   ├── custom
│   │   └── logo.png
│   └── custom-theme.css
├── bp.exe
```

Then you can customize the styling by editing the `custom-theme.css` file.
